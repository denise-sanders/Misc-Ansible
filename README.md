# Misc-Ansible
small Ansible files that don't deserve their own repo, kept for reference or reuse

Basically Im moving my small ansible files up to this project.

If you are learning ansible, and dont understand all the concepts and how things work together, I wrote a blog post that probably helps more than it hurts: http://blog.rackspace.com/how-to-deploy-ansible-accessible-explanation/

If you already get the high level and need a more detailed post to get started, look no further because this is a great article: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-an-ubuntu-12-04-vps
